<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The entire absence of criticism on the decennial tables
contained in the report of Mr. Horace Mann on the Census of
Religious Worship has filled the writer with equal surprise and
concern.&nbsp; For a period of nearly three years, hardly a week
has passed without some injurious step on the part of the
Government, some disastrous admission on the part of a friend,
some daring rhodomontade on the part of a foe&mdash;all of which
have owed their origin more or less directly to the false and
mistaken view of the Church&rsquo;s position engendered by the
still more erroneous and misleading statistics so widely
disseminated by the Census report.&nbsp; Nor is there any
prospect that the evil will diminish&mdash;at least, until the
next Census.&nbsp; On the contrary, the idea that the Church has
proved a failure seems to gain strength, and the policy of
friends and foes alike appears to shape itself with special
reference to that assumed fact.</p>
<p>The writer does not wish to obtrude upon the public his own
calculations as if they were absolutely correct; but he is
satisfied that the account he has given of the <i>relative</i>
growth of Church and Dissent during the past half century is, if
anything, an understatement so far as the former is
concerned.&nbsp; Had Mr. Bright&rsquo;s very remarkable return
fallen sooner in his way he would probably have much modified his
estimate relating to Dissent; but, as the case was already
sufficiently strong for the main object he had in view, namely,
to demonstrate the monstrous fallacy of the official report, he
did not think it worth while to alter his calculations.&nbsp; His
own conviction, however, is that the gross number of additional
sittings supplied by Dissent is much more accurately represented
by the table given in page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page24">24</a></span> than by that in page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page20">20</a></span>.</p>
<p>The Census report on Education offers a tempting subject for
remark; but the writer has not thought it necessary to go further
into the matter than he has done in the note on page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page27">27</a></span>.&nbsp; For
the reasons there stated, it will appear that there are no
grounds whatever for asserting that the parents of this country
neglect to provide their children with the means of instruction
any <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>more
than they neglect to provide them with food or clothing.&nbsp; In
every class which by any stretch of the term can be called
&ldquo;respectable,&rdquo; parents do supply their children with
what they consider a sufficient education; and their idea of what
is sufficient is, after all, not much lower, everything
considered, than prevails amongst the middle classes, who, in a
country like this, must always fix the standard.&nbsp; The result
of the Census goes to show that the Legislature has adopted the
right course&mdash;that the way to obtain as large a number of
attendants at school as possible is to subsidise, not to
supersede, private exertion; and that it is even possible to fix
the rate of subsidy too high; for all experience proves that
parents will not enforce regular attendance, unless they feel
that if their children stay away from school they will not
receive something for which they have paid.&nbsp; Whether the
Government ought to hold its hand until children of a certain
class are brought to the prison schoolmaster is quite another and
a different question; for it is clear that under any
circumstances those unfortunates must be treated in an
exceptional manner.&nbsp; Even if we had a national system,
children belonging to &ldquo;the dangerous classes&rdquo; would
not be admitted to the common schools; for no respectable person,
however humble, would allow his sons or his daughters to
associate with the offspring of habitual thieves or beggars.</p>
<p>It is proper to add, in order to account for certain local
illustrations, which it has been thought advisable to retain,
that the substance of the following pages first appeared in a
somewhat different form in the <i>Nottingham Journal</i>.</p>
<p><i>December</i>, 1856.</p>
<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE
TRUTH, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many changes which the
present age has witnessed, none are more remarkable than those we
have seen take place in the public mind with regard to the Church
of this country.</p>
<p>Thirty or forty years ago, the popular estimate of what was
called the Established Religion was as low as can well be
conceived.&nbsp; The laity, for the most part, regarded
Churchmanship as a mere empty tradition, or at best as a
political symbol, and an excuse for lusty choruses in praise of
&ldquo;a jolly full bottle.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Clergy, unless they
were grievously maligned, had but two objects in life&mdash;the
acquirement of &ldquo;fat livings,&rdquo; and the enjoyment of
amusements not now considered clerical.&nbsp; Of course, there
never was a time when there were not hundreds of exemplary
persons in holy orders; but that the prevailing impression was
wholly without foundation it would take a bold man to
affirm.&nbsp; The worldliness of the Clergy of the eighteenth
century has even left its mark on the language.&nbsp; The word
&ldquo;curate&rdquo; literally means a
&ldquo;cur&eacute;&rdquo;&mdash;a person charged with the cure of
souls, one that has the spiritual care of a parish.&nbsp; Such is
its meaning in the Prayer Book, and such was its signification
down to the last &ldquo;Review&rdquo;; but now it has come to
mean only a hireling, or an assistant.&nbsp; In like manner,
&ldquo;Parson&rdquo; was the most honourable title a parochial
clergyman could possess; and that, no doubt, continued to be the
case so late as the time of George Herbert.&nbsp; The beneficed
Clergy under the Hanoverian dynasty, however, so conducted
themselves, that the term is now never used, except by those who
wish to speak disrespectfully of the profession, or of some
individual belonging to it.</p>
<p>It would be wrong, perhaps, to hold the Clergy entirely
responsible for the sad phase through which we have lately
passed.&nbsp; That they were what they were was &ldquo;more their
misfortune than their fault.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>worst, they
were probably better than the rest of the community, and, save
when by a persecution to the death the Church is forced into a
position of direct antagonism to the world, it would be idle to
expect it to be much in advance of the age.&nbsp; The short reign
of the Puritans so confounded religion with cant that at the
Restoration it had come to be thought a sort of virtue to be
ungodly.&nbsp; The Church set itself manfully to resist the evil,
and no doubt it would soon have been successful; but,
unfortunately, the Nonjuring difficulty supervened.&nbsp; Now, it
is the misery of a crisis of that description, that the community
in which it occurs suffers every way.&nbsp; The men whose labours
it actually loses are necessarily amongst the most conscientious,
and, therefore, the most valuable, of its ministers; and those
who stay behind have their usefulness impaired by the stigma
which is cast upon their motives.&nbsp; For, if there are two men
under precisely the same obligations, and one of them feels
compelled for conscience&rsquo; sake to surrender all his worldly
prospects, people will never be persuaded that the other, who
does not follow the same example, has not sacrificed his
convictions to his material interests.&nbsp; We have seen many
instances in our own time in which this has occurred.&nbsp; Even
at this moment many good Churchmen are reproached with a love of
filthy lucre because they do not follow a few who once thought
with them, but who have apostatized from the faith of their
fathers; whereas, if there be a man in the world to whom
secession under any pretext is impossible it is the consistent
Anglican&mdash;the distinguishing tenet of whose school is the
spiritual equality of bishops, and the consequent indefeasible
authority of that episcopal line which has from time immemorial
been in possession of a given country.&nbsp; In England, the
existing Romanist succession was avowedly created by a Papal bull
in the year 1850; and it is, therefore, on the face of it, an
intrusion, and a usurpation of the rights which are inherent in
the representatives of St. Austin and St. Anselm.&nbsp; Yet,
because a few Anglicans have become Ultramontanists&mdash;a step
which involved to them as distinct a giving up of all their
former principles as it would have been for a Catholic to become
a Socinian&mdash;the &ldquo;High Church&rdquo; clergy are reviled
for retaining their benefices, and declining to follow the
footsteps of a Faber and a Newman!&nbsp; In like manner, we may
be sure that those Clergymen who conscientiously felt that they
might withdraw their allegiance from King James, reaped a loss of
influence for good, even among the partisans of King
William.&nbsp; Close upon the Nonjuring troubles followed the
scandalous attempt of the Hanoverian Government to undermine the
faith of the Church by means of improper episcopal appointments,
its resistance by the inferior clergy, and the consequent
suppression of Convocation.&nbsp; The mischief to which this most
unconstitutional step has given rise can hardly be
overrated.&nbsp; We can scarcely conceive the confusion and <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>corruption
which would creep into the body politic if Parliament were
forcibly silenced for a whole century; and there is no reason why
the English Church should prosper without representative
institutions and free speech any more than the English
nation.&nbsp; Under any circumstances, the Church, deprived of
her parliament, must have greatly suffered; much more so in the
face of those vast changes which have come about in the extent
and distribution of the population.&nbsp; The machinery of the
existing Church Establishment was designed for a population of
five or six million souls.&nbsp; By 1821 the inhabitants of this
country had increased to twelve millions.&nbsp; A new population
exceeding the old one had thus been introduced, for which the
Church as a body had no means of providing a single additional
bishop or a single new sitting.&nbsp; Had the increase been
evenly spread over the country the mischief would not have been
so great; but, unfortunately, the new population chose all kinds
of out-of-the-way places in which to settle.&nbsp; A rural parish
suddenly found itself a metropolis; and a district, once
traversed only by the shepherd or the ploughboy, became the
teeming hive of manufacturing industry.&nbsp; In such a state of
things the parochial system&mdash;perfect as it is where the
Church has wholly subdued a country&mdash;miserably broke
down.&nbsp; A signal failure was in fact inevitable; for what
were the solitary parish priests of Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds,
Bradford, St. Pancras, St. Marylebone, Islington, or Lambeth,
amongst so many!&nbsp; For all practical purposes it may be
asserted that at least half of the new population were as much
beyond the reach of the Church of England as if they had settled
in the woods of Canada or on the plains of Hindostan.&nbsp; Year
after year the evil went on increasing, until at last the number
of Englishmen who did not belong to the Established Church became
so great that a Parliament of Churchmen were obliged to surrender
their exclusive right of legislation and government.&nbsp; The
prospects of the Church were at this time truly deplorable.&nbsp;
Its very existence as an establishment was doubtful.&nbsp; The
Whig Premier actually bade the bishops &ldquo;set their house in
order;&rdquo; and the experiment of confiscation was begun.&nbsp;
Humanly speaking it was only the difficulty of disposing of the
plunder that saved the Church of these realms.</p>
<p>The hour of danger, however, was not of long duration.&nbsp; A
new school of theologians arose, who boldly asserted that the
Church was not a creature of the State, to be dealt with at the
pleasure or convenience of politicians, but a Divine institution,
with laws, privileges, and a polity of its own; and that the duty
of extending its usefulness belonged to individual exertions not
less than to the Legislature.&nbsp; The effect of this new
teaching, as it then appeared, was electric.&nbsp; Churchmen no
longer sat with hands folded in blank despair, or amused
themselves with irrefutable demonstrations that Parliament ought
to do something.&nbsp; <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>They set to work themselves.&nbsp;
Sometimes it was the clergy who stimulated the laity; sometimes
it was the laity who applied a gentle compulsion to the
clergy.&nbsp; Churches, parsonages, and schools began to spring
up in every direction, with a rapidity that would have borne
comparison with the palmiest days of the medi&aelig;val
builders.&nbsp; The ancient indigenous architecture of the
country, and its cognate arts, were in a manner rediscovered, and
were brought to a perfection scarcely less than that attained by
the greatest masters of antiquity.&nbsp; Indeed, the spread of
this new science of ecclesiology has been not the least marvel of
the present century.&nbsp; It has pervaded every part of the
community; it has slain outright the bastard classicalism of the
Age of Pigtail; and it has reproduced itself in the Puginism of
the Romanists, and the Ruskinism of Dissent.&nbsp; It has even
crossed the Channel, and appeared in the very centre of European
taste&mdash;in Paris itself&mdash;the fount and origin of the
whole vast movement being the work of church-building and
restoration in this country, which has proved a school of art
more effective, because on an infinitely larger scale, than any
which modern times have witnessed.</p>
<p>All this has been, moreover, but the symbol of a greater and
yet more gratifying change&mdash;the gradual rehabilitation of
the Church&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; Never since the Reformation
did it occupy so high a position as that to which it had attained
two or three years ago.&nbsp; Old scandals, and old epithets of
abuse founded upon them, had alike disappeared.&nbsp; We read of
Parson Trulliber with much the same feeling of incredulous
amazement as we perused the accounts of Professor Owen&rsquo;s
extinct monsters; and we should have looked upon the person who
indulged in the sort of Billingsgate which was common half a
century ago as if another Rip Van Winkle had stood before
us.&nbsp; The ingenious calculations in which demagogues of the
last generation used to indulge, with regard to what might be
done with the ecclesiastical revenues, seemed like prospectuses
of the South Sea Company.&nbsp; The very Horsmans, like their
Puritan prototypes who made war on the King in the King&rsquo;s
name, had begun to profess a desire only to increase the
Church&rsquo;s efficiency.&nbsp; The Anti-State-Church Society
itself, borne away by the spirit of the times, adopted a clumsy
euphemism for its old out-spoken title.&nbsp; It no longer sought
to destroy &ldquo;the State Church&rdquo;&mdash;its object was
the &ldquo;Liberation of Religion from State Patronage and
Control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more, alas! the sky has changed.&nbsp; What the public
now think of the Church, it would be difficult exactly to say;
but that a strong re-action has set in, it would be vain to
deny.&nbsp; There seems to be an impression abroad that the
Church has been taking credit for far more than she was entitled
to; that she has had a last trial allowed her, whether she would
regain her place as the Church of the people; that her day of
grace <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>has
passed, and that she has been found wanting.&nbsp; Political
Dissent, which had fallen into a state of such ludicrous
obscurity, has suddenly revived, and in a Parliament elected
under Lord Derby has achieved what it could never do even in the
worst times which followed the passing of the Reform
Bill&mdash;it has effected a lodgment in the Universities.&nbsp;
It has several times carried resolutions adverse to
Churchrates.&nbsp; The demands of Mr. Pellatt are now granted
almost as a matter of course; and not only so, but the very
Government goes out of its way to flatter the prejudices of the
Nonconformist.&nbsp; Thus, the Solicitor-General brings in a
Testamentary Jurisdiction Bill, which would saddle the country
with an enormous annual charge in the shape of compensations; the
sole object being to afford Dissenters the gratification of
reading at the commencement of their probates the words
&ldquo;Victoria, by the Grace of God, Queen,&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;John Bird, by Divine Providence, Archbishop.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Some of the concessions which have been made to &ldquo;the rights
of conscience&rdquo; are absolutely ludicrous.&nbsp; For example,
young ladies and gentlemen of the different denominations
complain that ill-natured people call their weddings
&ldquo;workhouse marriages.&rdquo;&nbsp; A remedy is instantly
found, at the risk of establishing a Gretna Green in every
Dissenting place of worship.&nbsp; In a word, the Legislature
seems to say to Dissent &ldquo;Ask and have.&rdquo;&nbsp; Very
different is the tone both of Parliament and of the Executive,
towards the Church.&nbsp; The prayer of the Convocation for
permission to reform its constitution is, notwithstanding the
plighted faith of the Crown, peremptorily refused.&nbsp; The
Royal Letters on behalf of the Church Societies are stopped; the
bill drawn up by the bishops to enfranchise the Colonial Church
is rejected.&nbsp; It is perhaps hardly worth while to speak of
various shabby acts with regard to money votes, such as the
withdrawal of the grants to the Bishop of New Zealand and to the
Scottish Church; but the animus which dictated them is only too
obvious.&nbsp; After all, however, the saddest evidence that the
public feeling has undergone a great change is to be found in the
Education Bill of Sir John Pakington.&nbsp; Every one knows how
fast the Church was becoming, in fact, what she is in theory, the
instructress of the people; and till lately no Churchman could
have been found to suggest any material alteration in a system
which was bringing forth such gratifying fruits.&nbsp; Suddenly,
however, Sir John is seized with a panic.&nbsp; The task appears
in his eyes to be utterly hopeless, and he brings in a bill which
would have destroyed the distinctive character of Church schools,
and would have deprived Churchmen of all share (save that of
paying school taxes) in the education of every district in which
they could not command an absolute majority!</p>
<p>That the Church is inefficient, every one now seems to take
for granted&mdash;the only matter in dispute is, what has been
the cause?&nbsp; Of course the <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>fault is always laid at the door of
the Clergy; but it is amusing to observe the perplexity which
appears to be felt as to the manner in which the indictment
against them should be framed.&nbsp; Sometimes the charge is that
they cannot preach&mdash;just as if orators were a whit more
plentiful at the bar or in the senate, on the stage or in the
Dissenting pulpit.&nbsp; Sometimes we are told that the Clergy
are not abler men because they are not better paid.&nbsp; We have
actually lived to see it stated by the <i>Times</i>, that the
Clergy of the Church of England&mdash;the men who a few short
years ago were reported to be rolling in wealth&mdash;are worse
rewarded in this life than persons belonging to any other
profession whatever!</p>
<p>The object of the present essay is to strike at the very first
step in the <i>sorites</i>&mdash;to show that the Church, since
the great revival, so far from having proved a failure, has
proved herself more than equal to the situation; and finally to
point out how grievously both the public and the Legislature have
been deceived by the data which have been published for their
guidance.</p>
<p>It need hardly be observed that the unfavourable impression to
which allusion has been made has been entirely created by Mr.
Horace Mann&rsquo;s Report on the Census of Religious
Worship.&nbsp; That report has been assailed by the Bishop of
Oxford, and other right reverend prelates; but their strictures,
it is respectfully submitted, do not go quite to the point.&nbsp;
It is not the account given of the present relative positions of
Church and Dissent which has done the mischief.&nbsp; Every one
knew that the Church was strongest in the country and Dissent in
the towns; and seeing that the rural and the urban population
were about equal, the public could scarcely be surprised to learn
that the two bodies were also of nearly equal strength.&nbsp;
According to the census, the Church had in 1851, 5,317,915
sittings, and the Dissenters 4,894,648; but the Bishop of Oxford
has shown that there are good reasons for believing that the
Church sittings have been unfairly diminished, while those
belonging to Dissenters have been much exaggerated.&nbsp; On that
point the writer will only add that the number of sittings
assigned to the Churches in the tables relating to one large
town, the only one he has had occasion to verify, is not above
three-fourths of the real amount.</p>
<p>The total number of attendants at Church on the census morning
was 2,541,244, against 2,106,238 in the meeting-houses.&nbsp;
Now, without pressing any objection that might be made to these
figures on the score of dishonesty in the returns, it must be
obvious that they do not fairly represent the average
attendance.&nbsp; In the first place, such institutions as the
colleges at the Universities are not taken into account.&nbsp; In
the next place, no reference is made to such places as the
workhouses, in most of which service is performed by a chaplain,
and from which the dissenting inmates are allowed to attend the
meeting-houses of their respective <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>communities.&nbsp; Thirdly, the
weather on the census Sunday was very inclement, and while the
attendance generally would, no doubt, be less than an average,
the effect would, beyond all controversy, be much more felt in
Churches than in meeting-houses.&nbsp; The strength of the
Church, it has already been said, is in the country, and it is
quite a different thing in bad weather to walk a few hundred
yards along a well-paved street, and to trudge a mile down a
muddy lane.&nbsp; Fourthly, the attendants at all the morning
masses in Roman Catholic chapels are returned, whereas it is well
known that devout persons of that persuasion often
&ldquo;assist&rdquo; at more than one mass on the same
morning.&nbsp; Those persons have thus been counted twice
over.&nbsp; Lastly, the day on which the census was taken was
Mid-Lent Sunday, on which rustics in the northern counties are
accustomed to pay visits to their friends instead of attending
Divine service.&nbsp; That, in its degree, would also act
unfavourably on the church-going of the census Sunday.&nbsp; If,
therefore, we said that on ordinary occasions there were three
quarters of a million more people at church on Sunday mornings in
1851 than in all the dissenting places of worship put together,
we should probably not be overstating the case; and there would
certainly be nothing in a state of things like that to account
for any alteration in the public sentiment.</p>
<p>When, however, we come to look at the statements made as to
the relative <i>progress</i> of the two bodies during the last
half century our wonder at the change which has taken place in
public opinion ceases.&nbsp; The following results, compiled from
Tables 5 and 13 of Mr. Mann&rsquo;s Report, will exhibit at a
glance the amount of population and the number of sittings in
1801, as well as the subsequent increase at each decennial period
since then:&mdash;</p>

<p>So that while the Church has lost 185 sittings, Dissent has
gained 174.&nbsp; In other words, the Church has experienced a
total relative loss of 359 sittings per thousand of the
population during the last 50 years.&nbsp; Even since 1831 her
loss, as compared with Dissent, has not been less than 118 per
thousand!</p>
<p>Comment on this would be superfluous.&nbsp; If such be really
the state of the case it would be idle to waste time in wrangling
over inaccuracies in the returns.&nbsp; If Dissent is gaining on
the Church at the rate of 50,000, sittings per year, whatever may
be wrong in the present totals must soon be corrected; and the
Church must make up its mind, ere long, to sink down into a
minority.</p>
<p>The only question is, does the Census Report state the
truth?&nbsp; <i>It does not</i>.&nbsp; On the contrary, it states
the very reverse of the truth.&nbsp; It is not merely inaccurate,
but altogether false.&nbsp; Mr. Mann&rsquo;s
figures&mdash;although they have hitherto been accepted on all
sides as if they were &ldquo;proofs of Holy
Writ&rdquo;&mdash;rest upon no positive data whatever.&nbsp; So
far, indeed, are they from possessing any claim upon the
confidence of the public, the smallest effort of common sense,
the most transient recollection of principles laid down by the
immortal Cocker, would have warned Mr. Mann that the process he
has adopted could not possibly lead to a correct result.</p>
<p>It appears that as soon as the 30,610 districts into which the
country was divided for the purposes of the census had been
marked out, the enumerator in each was directed to return to the
head office a list of all the places of worship within his
jurisdiction.&nbsp; The result was to obtain information
respecting 14,077 churches or chapels, and 20,390 dissenting
meetings.&nbsp; Circulars were then sent out to the clergy, the
ministers, or other official persons, requesting to know, amongst
other things, the number of attendants on Sunday, the 30th of
March, 1851, the number of sittings, and the date at which the
building was erected, or first appropriated to religious worship
(if since 1801).&nbsp; The report adds that&mdash;&ldquo;When
delivering the schedules to the proper parties, the enumerators
told them it was not compulsory upon them to reply to the
inquiries; but that their compliance with the invitation was
entirely left to their own sense of the importance and the value
to the public of the information sought.&rdquo;&nbsp; As might
have been expected there were very many instances <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>in which no
returns were made.&nbsp; These instances were &ldquo;principally
places of worship in connexion with the Church of
England,&mdash;several of the clergy having entertained some
scruples about complying with an invitation not proceeding from
episcopal authority.&nbsp; In all such cases, a second
application was made direct from the Census-office, and this
generally was favoured by a courteous return of the particulars
desired.&nbsp; The few remaining cases were remitted to the
registrar, who either got the necessary information from the
secular officers of the church, or else supplied, from his own
knowledge, or from the most attainable and accurate sources, an
estimate of the number of sittings and of the usual
congregation.&rdquo;&nbsp; After all, the number of sittings
could not be obtained in 2,134 cases, the number of attendants in
1,004, and the number either of sittings or attendants in
390.</p>
<p>With regard to the tables more immediately under notice,
namely those which profess to show the comparative progress of
Church and Dissent during the last half-century, the mode of
proceeding was as follows:&mdash;The buildings were first of all
arranged under six heads&mdash;those erected or appropriated to
religious purposes prior to 1801, and those erected or so
appropriated during five subsequent periods.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Mann&rsquo;s next step was to distribute the last line

Multiplying the results so arrived at by the present average

<p>It would be uncandid not to state that Mr. Mann admits this
estimate to be open to some objection.&nbsp; His words
are:&mdash;&ldquo;It is probable that an inference as to the
position of affairs in former times can be drawn from <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the dates of
existing buildings with more correctness in the ease of the
Church of England, as the edifices are more permanent and less
likely to change hands than are the buildings used by the
dissenters.&nbsp; Still there is a possibility that too great an
amount of accommodation has been ascribed to the earlier
periods.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tables are, therefore, to be taken with
a &ldquo;certain degree of qualification from this
cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; With respect to the Nonconformists, he
observes in a note:&mdash;&ldquo;In 1801, according to the
estimate from dates, * * * the Dissenters had only 3,701
buildings.&nbsp; This, however, is scarcely probable, and seems
to prove that many Dissenters&rsquo; buildings, existing in
former years, have since become disused, or have been replaced by
others.&nbsp; As so much depends upon the extent to which this
disuse and substitution have prevailed, these calculations, in
the absence of any facts upon those points, must necessarily be
open to some doubts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, it may be taken for
granted that no one reading these very mild qualifications would
suppose that they were intended to cover any serious error.&nbsp;
Everybody would conclude that the mere fact of Mr. Mann&rsquo;s
tables appearing in a grave public document was a guarantee that
they were in the main correct.&nbsp; Indeed, the suspicion that
they were not perfectly trustworthy never seemed to have entered
into anyone&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The Society for the Liberation of
Religion lost no time in issuing a manifesto grounded upon them,
and the dissenting prints have dwelt on them with great
emphasis.&nbsp; Thus the <i>Patriot</i>, some time ago, declared,
with a sort of oath, that &ldquo;as surely as the morrow&rsquo;s
sun would rise,&rdquo; so surely would Dissent be in a majority
at the next census.&nbsp; On the faith of these tables, too, Mr.
Hadfield announced, at the close of last session, that a spirit
was growing up which would not much longer tolerate such an
abomination as a religious establishment; and Mr. Gurney, in his
sermon at the consecration of the Bishops of Gloucester and
Christchurch, admitted that Dissent was gaining ground.</p>
<p>Proceeding, without further comment, to examine the Tables in
detail, it must be remarked that Mr. Mann&rsquo;s formula for
distributing the dateless buildings is open to very strong
objections.&nbsp; It is not, however, necessary to enter upon
those objections at this point, because the operation of the rule
with regard to the churches (which shall be dealt with first)
happens by accident to be very nearly right&mdash;the number
assigned to the year 1831 corresponding pretty closely with the
number arrived at by the census inquiries in that year.&nbsp; Mr.
Mann&rsquo;s next step, however, is begging the question with a
vengeance.&nbsp; The circumstance that churches now-a-days
contain on the average 377 sittings, affords not the least ground
for supposing that the average capacity of churches was 377,
fifty years ago.&nbsp; On the contrary, it is absolutely
impossible, from the nature of church extension in modern times,
that the average <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>should have remained stationary.&nbsp; First of all,
everybody knows that churches in large towns are, generally
speaking, much more spacious than those in the rest of the
country; and unless, therefore, the proportion of large town and
country churches has remained exactly the same, the general
average capacity of churches must have been disturbed.&nbsp; Mr.
Mann&rsquo;s Table 14 deprives him of any excuse he might have
had for overlooking this obvious fact.&nbsp; From that table we
learn that there were in 1851:&mdash;</p>

<p>The number of churches is the same as in the general table,
but the number of sittings is less by 158,198.&nbsp; The
discrepancy, however, is soon explained.&nbsp; The average
capacity of the larger town churches is 577 sittings, or 200
above the general average, while that of the country churches is
312, or only 65 less; and, while as many as 1,294 new buildings
of the former class have been erected, the number of the latter
class has only been 1,404.&nbsp; On Mr. Mann&rsquo;s own showing,
therefore, his principle is erroneous, and his Table 13 has
cheated the Church of nearly 160,000 sittings.&nbsp; But this is
by no means the whole of the injustice of which he has been
guilty.&nbsp; Not merely have there been more churches built in
large towns than is consistent with maintaining the old average
on the country at large, but the new structures both in town and
country are of far greater dimensions than those anciently
erected.&nbsp; An Englishman is not naturally fond of large
communities of any kind.&nbsp; He has a passion for privacy; and
his pet phrases are &ldquo;snug,&rdquo; &ldquo;nice
little,&rdquo; &ldquo;not numerous, but select.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
feeling breaks out in everything.&nbsp; Take the matter of
lodging.&nbsp; Abroad, many families club together, and occupy a
mansion.&nbsp; The plan has been tried in this country; but it
meets with little success.&nbsp; Most men would regard themselves
as &ldquo;flats&rdquo; indeed, if they put up with a floor when
they could get a house; and working men regard model
lodging-houses as little better than barracks, or, as they still
term them, &ldquo;bastiles.&rdquo;&nbsp; So in ecclesiastical
arrangements, John Bull, looking upon the parish as but an
extension of the family, cannot have it too little for his
taste.&nbsp; Abroad, the parish is regarded more in the light of
a city within a city; and hence parochial churches on the
continent were always less numerous and far <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>larger than
was anciently the case in this country.&nbsp; Even when we had
large churches they were not fitted up for many
worshippers&mdash;size being regarded more a matter of dignity
than of practical utility.&nbsp; London, before the Great Fire,
with its vast cathedral, and its hundred and ten parish churches;
or Norwich, with its spacious minster, and its forty churches,
fairly represent the true English idea.&nbsp; In modern times,
however, we are forced to act differently.&nbsp; The sudden
increase of population, and the utter unpreparedness of the
Church to grapple with the difficulty, have produced an emergency
of which our forefathers had no experience.&nbsp; We adopt the
continental custom from sheer necessity, just as in London a
third of the population are obliged, though much against their
will, to live in lodgings.&nbsp; We build our churches large
because that is the cheapest mode of supplying our immediate
wants.&nbsp; The two systems may be well illustrated by
contrasting Norwich, with its 41 churches and 17,000 sittings,
with Manchester, which has 32 churches and 44,000 sittings; or by
comparing the City with its 73 churches and 42,000 sittings with
the Tower Hamlets which have 65 churches and 68,000
sittings.&nbsp; The census tables contain many materials for an
inferential argument with regard to the size of our new churches,
but it is hardly necessary to pursue the matter further, because
we have ample direct evidence bearing upon the point.&nbsp; The
Metropolis Church Building Society has assisted in the erection
of 85 churches, which contain 106,000 sittings, or an average of
1,247 each.&nbsp; The Church Building Commissioners have aided
520 churches, and have thus assisted in providing 565,780
sittings, which would give an average of 1,088 each.&nbsp; Even
Mr. Mann himself admits, with amusing <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>,
that &ldquo;for many reasons the churches in large towns are
constructed of considerable size, and rarely with accommodation
for less than 1,000 persons!&rdquo;&nbsp; [Report page
clxii.]&nbsp; Precisely the same reasoning will apply to the
Church extension of the rural districts; and the reader who has
duly weighed the facts just stated will be little disposed to
doubt that in both cases the average size of modern churches is
at least double that of the churches which were in existence
prior to 1801.&nbsp; On that hypothesis it would be found by an
easy arithmetical problem that the capacity of town churches, in
1801, was 420 sittings, and of country ones, 276.&nbsp; The
increase in the former class would thus have been 1,086,960
sittings, and in the latter 775,008&mdash;making together
1,861,968.&nbsp; Probably it was much more; but at all events the
calculation omits a very important element, namely, the new
sittings which have been obtained by the enlargement or the
re-arrangement of old fabrics.&nbsp; From the statistics of above
a score of Church Building Societies, it would appear that for
every additional structure at least two old ones are rebuilt or
enlarged.&nbsp; There must thus have been at least 5,000 of these
cases; and though <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>there are no accessible data on which to calculate the
amount of new accommodation in this manner afforded, it must have
been very considerable.</p>
<p>On the whole, therefore, we may safely adopt the statistics of
the Incorporated Society for Building and Enlarging Churches as
our guide.&nbsp; This society has laboured impartially for the
advantage of town and country; and up to the year 1851 it had
assisted in erecting 884 new churches, and in rebuilding or
enlarging 2,174 old ones.&nbsp; The total amount of new sittings
it had thus been instrumental in providing was 835,000; so that
each new church would <i>represent</i> an increase of
accommodation to the extent of 944 sittings.&nbsp; As, however,
the society probably assisted the more urgent cases, it would
perhaps be safer to assume that each new church has only
represented an increase of 850 new sittings&mdash;in other words,
that the new churches not assisted by the society represent about
800 each.&nbsp; The result will then be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Turning now to the Dissenting tables, we shall find that Mr.
Mann&rsquo;s formula leads to still more absurd results than when
it is applied to the churches.&nbsp; It has, however, the curious
felicity of operating in the two cases in a manner diametrically
opposite; for while it robs the Church of more than half the new
accommodation which she has provided, it obligingly credits
Dissent with about the same number of sittings, to which it has
not the ghost of a claim.</p>
<p>It is the proper place to offer here a few remarks upon the
mode which has been adopted for distributing the dateless
buildings amongst the six periods.&nbsp; Every one is, of course,
aware that in many cases &ldquo;there is much virtue&rdquo; in an
average.&nbsp; In such problems as determining the number of
letters which will be posted in a given year without being
addressed, it operates with almost infallible certainty.&nbsp;
But it must be clear that 2,428 out of 20,390 places could not
have been returned without dates by mere accident.&nbsp; In a
large proportion of cases the omission must have been
intentional; and it is obvious that those cases would include
very few new buildings.&nbsp; The enumerators, being all persons
possessed of local knowledge, could have had no difficulty in
determining whether a building had or had not been erected within
the last ten, twenty, or thirty years.&nbsp; It would only be in
cases where the <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>structure was of what is called in ladies&rsquo;
sometimes &ldquo;a certain,&rdquo; sometimes &ldquo;an
uncertain&rdquo; age, that they would be unable to ascertain when
it was erected or appropriated to public worship.&nbsp; The
number of such instances would bear no relation whatever to the
number having dates assigned.&nbsp; The case is wholly beyond the
province of the Rule of Three; and to attempt to adjust the table
by means of proportion is, on the face of it, unfair.&nbsp; Out
of the 2,118 dateless churches, no fewer than 1,712 are relegated
to the number of those erected before 1801, whereas of the 2,428
dateless meeting-houses, only 465 would be placed in the same
category.&nbsp; In point of fact, however, there are not so many;
for Mr. Mann has hit on a plan, which is a miracle of perverse
ingenuity, in order to make the growth of Dissent during the half
century look larger than ever.&nbsp; Ninety-nine persons out of a
hundred would have applied the rule first to the churches, then
to the meeting-houses, and then they would have added the results
together.&nbsp; Mr. Mann has adopted precisely the opposite
course.&nbsp; He has, first of all, dealt with the total column,
then with the Church, and he has lastly subtracted the one set of
results from the other.&nbsp; The consequence is he has assigned
no more than 274 of the dateless meeting-houses to the period
before 1801.&nbsp; The total number he has distributed amongst
the first three periods is only 737, whereas he has divided no
fewer than 1,691 amongst the last three.&nbsp; It need scarcely
be said that all the probabilities would be all in favour of
reversing the process.</p>
<p>At the outset, therefore, Mr. Mann&rsquo;s estimate comes
before us under circumstances of extreme suspicion; but,
granting, for the sake of argument, that his distribution of the
existing meeting-houses were correct, it must be obvious that any
inference from dates would be preposterous unless we could be
certain that there were no buildings in existence at the earlier
periods, other than those included in the table.&nbsp; It has
been seen that Mr. Mann has not overlooked this
circumstance.&nbsp; He admits that the small number assigned to
1801 &ldquo;seems to prove that many dissenters&rsquo; buildings
existing in former years have since become disused or have been
replaced by others;&rdquo; but no one would suspect from this
statement the vast number of these disused buildings.&nbsp; Take,
for example, the case of Nottingham.&nbsp; From Mr. Wylie&rsquo;s
local history it would appear that of the 29 meeting-houses
returned to the Census Office, only six dated back to the
commencement of the present century.&nbsp; In other words,
dissent in Nottingham, on Mr. Mann&rsquo;s hypothesis, all but
quintupled itself during the 50 years.&nbsp; In point of fact,
however, there were, not six, but thirteen or fourteen,
dissenting congregations in 1801, and probably several more whose
&ldquo;memorial has perished with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The absurdity of the Census estimate may be still further
illustrated <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>by a reference once more to Tables 6 and 14.&nbsp; Those
tables are to Mr. Mann&rsquo;s calculation not very different
from the proof of an addition sum.&nbsp; If his estimate were
right they would agree with Tables 5 and 13; but instead of doing
so, they lead to the following astounding results:&mdash;In 1851,
there were in the</p>

<p>The late Mr. Hume&rsquo;s emphatic appreciation of a certain
&ldquo;modest assurance&rdquo; as a means towards getting through
life will be remembered.&nbsp; How the lamented sage would have
envied the courage of Mr. Mann in putting his name to a document
embodying these statements!&nbsp; It is really much the same as
if the Astronomer Royal had presented to Parliament an elaborate
calculation, signed with his proper name, in which he proved the
diameter of the earth to be 25,000 miles, and its circumference
8,000!&nbsp; Seriously, the very least one might have expected
from a public servant performing an important official duty would
have been to abandon calculations which he must have observed led
to nonsensical consequences; and not to put forth statements
which, while they involved a gross libel upon the most venerable
institution in the country, were calculated to prove, as they
have proved, so fatally misleading.&nbsp; These very Tables 6 and
14 are of great importance.&nbsp; We are constantly hearing that
the great towns monopolise the intelligence of the age, and that
it is they which are to govern the country.&nbsp; What then, has
been the verdict of the great towns on the question&mdash;Church
<i>versus</i> Dissent?&nbsp; According to these tables, the
Church, in the large towns, has provided only 747,027 sittings to
meet an increase in the population of 5,621,096 souls.&nbsp;
Dissent, in the meantime, has furnished 1,873,305, or more than
twice as many.&nbsp; The Church&rsquo;s increase is not
two-thirds the number of sittings she originally possessed; the
increase of Dissent is more than sevenfold!&nbsp; If these
figures were only correct, it would hardly be possible to
conceive a more complete condemnation of the Church&rsquo;s
system; if they are not&mdash;and there is no reason to think
that Dissent has materially altered its position in the large
towns since 1801&mdash;it is impossible to imagine a more
scandalous or a more gratuitous calumny.</p>
<p>Mr. Mann&rsquo;s formula proving utterly untrustworthy, the
question arises, are there any data on which a substantially
correct notion of the number of Dissenting sittings in 1801 may
be arrived at?&nbsp; To the writer, it appears that there
are.&nbsp; Thus, from the statistics of the different <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Wesleyan
bodies appended to Mr. Mann&rsquo;s report, it would appear that
the old and new Connections in 1801 had at least 100,000
members.&nbsp; It would further appear, that for every member the
Wesleyans have about four sittings, so that in 1801 the Wesleyans
must have had at least 400,000 sittings.&nbsp; The next question
is, what proportion did the Wesleyans bear to the aggregate
Nonconformity of 1801?&nbsp; At present, the Wesleyan sects have
about 11/24ths of the entire number of Dissenting sittings; but
their ratio of progress has confessedly been double that of their
fellow Nonconformists.&nbsp; Mr. Mann&rsquo;s process of
calculating from dates, unsatisfactory as it is in other
respects, may, perhaps, be allowed to decide how much of the
entire Dissenting accommodation of 1801 was possessed by the
Wesleyan bodies.&nbsp; According to table 17, the old and new
Connections had between them only 165,000 sittings, out of the
881,240.&nbsp; It has been shown, however, that they had, in
reality, not less than 400,000; and, raising the sittings
belonging to the other sects in the same proportion, we get a
total of 2,136,339.&nbsp; This result receives complete
corroboration from Mr. Mann&rsquo;s own returns.&nbsp; First of
all, it is clear that meeting-houses which have remained in
existence half a century must be buildings of some
importance.&nbsp; Dissenting places of worship are of two
classes&mdash;those which have regular congregations and a
regular ministry attached to them, and those which are merely
temporary preaching stations.&nbsp; The number of these latter
will surprise the reader.&nbsp; Mr. Edward Baines, in his
evidence before the Churchrates Committee, estimated that no
fewer than 7,360 of the 19,000 which he supposed belonged to
&ldquo;the three denominations&rdquo; were of this
description.&nbsp; The total number of mere preaching stations,
however, may be easily ascertained.&nbsp; It may be safely
assumed that all places which have a regular ministry are opened
both on Sunday mornings and on Sunday afternoons or
evenings.&nbsp; The total number of this class in 1851 was only
10,583; so that each would <i>represent</i> an average of 462
sittings.&nbsp; Now, as the number of Dissenting places of
worship which date back to 1801 cannot be less, even if
calculated on Mr. Mann&rsquo;s principle, than 3900, the number
of sittings in that year must have been upwards of
1,800,000.&nbsp; But it would be a great fallacy to suppose that
even first-class Dissenting congregations are exempt from the
tendency to decay and disappear.&nbsp; If Nottingham may be taken
as a fair example, it would seem that not two-thirds of the
regularly organised congregations existing in 1801 survive to
this day.&nbsp; The total number of sittings at the commencement
of the present century would thus be at least 2,700,000.</p>
<p>The matter does not, however, rest even here.&nbsp; These
estimates are purely conjectural; but since the writer first
turned his attention to the subject, a valuable piece of positive
evidence has fallen in his way.&nbsp; It <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>is a
Parliamentary return obtained by Mr. Bright last year, which
professes to show the number of places of worship licensed under
the Toleration Act.&nbsp; It is very imperfect in its earlier
tables, but those since 1800 seem to be tolerably complete.&nbsp;
Comparing the number of places licensed during each of the last
five decennial periods with the number of existing buildings
returned to Mr. Mann as opened in each, we get the following
remarkable results:&mdash;<a name="citation19"></a><a

<p>This is a comparison which cannot fail to startle the editor
of the <i>Patriot</i>, and to shake the nerves of the Society for
the Liberation of Religion.&nbsp; It proves beyond the
possibility of cavil that the enormous and constantly increasing
growth which Mr. Mann&rsquo;s tables assign to modern Dissent is
&ldquo;a mockery, a delusion, and a snare.&rdquo;&nbsp; It shows,
moreover (which is the matter more immediately in hand), that
barely two in seven (21/75ths) of the Dissenting places of
worship which were in existence in 1801, are still
remaining.&nbsp; The number of such places was not 3,701, as Mr.
Mann states, but between 13,000 and 14,000; and the estimate of
sittings first made, after every conceivable allowance for
increase of average capacity, and other sources of error, is thus
greatly under rather than over the mark.&nbsp; The Dissenting
increase may, therefore, be safely taken at 2,758,309 sittings
instead of 4,013,408; and if it be distributed according to the
proportion of places licensed, matters will stand
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>If it be objected that the average capacity of Dissenting
buildings has increased of late years, there are two
answers&mdash;first, there is no evidence of such increase to any
material extent; and, secondly, that there is an antagonistic
influence at work, which would counterbalance such increase if it
existed.&nbsp; It must be clear that the number of
&ldquo;causes&rdquo; which annually collapse becomes greater in
the same ratio as the congregations themselves increase.&nbsp;
Thus, almost the same number of places were licensed in the ten
years ending 1810 as in the same period ending 1850; but the
number of places discontinued out of 13,000 would obviously be <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>less than the
number discontinued out of, say 18,500; so that unless the new
Dissenting meeting-houses are larger nowadays than was formerly
the case, the amount of sittings attributed to the latter periods
is too large, rather than too small.</p>

<p>Dissent has <i>not</i>, during the half century, supplied four
times as much new accommodation as the Church&mdash;if it has
supplied any more at all, the excess does not amount to a
fourth.</p>
<p>Dissent has <i>not</i>, during the last 20 years, supplied
three times as much accommodation as the Church&mdash;it has

<p>Dissent is <i>not</i> advancing at a pace twice as rapid as
the Church; on the contrary, the Church is advancing at nearly
three times the speed of Dissent.</p>
<p>Dissent has <i>not</i> improved its position, and the Church
has not lost position since 1831; on the contrary, the Church has
gained, and Dissent has lost, ground since that year.</p>
<p>Finally, as churches, save only where there is an excess of
accommodation as compared with the population, are at least as
well attended as dissenting places of worship, the charge of
comparative inefficiency which has been so rashly brought against
the clergy proves to be utterly without foundation.</p>
<p>Here, then, the present inquiry might be brought to a close;
and yet it would be palpably unfair to the Church to rest the
case upon a mere comparison of the additional sittings supplied
by her rivals and by herself.&nbsp; A new church, generally
speaking, means a very different thing from a <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>new
meeting-house.&nbsp; It means a substantially built and even
highly-decorative structure, the freehold of which is the
property of the community to which it belongs; it means decent
and becoming furniture for the performance of divine service;
provision for a properly educated minister in perpetuity; service
performed at least twice every Sunday, or even twice every day; a
house for the resident minister; a day-school, or rather a group
of day-schools; and a host of other benevolent and educational
agencies.&nbsp; If the establishment of the day-school be taken
as a criterion how far the parochial machinery has been
completed, the following table from the report of the Educational
Census will be instructive:&mdash;</p>

<p>What, on the other hand, is the status of a majority of the
20,390 buildings returned to the Census office as
&ldquo;chapels&rdquo; may be guessed from the fact that the total
number of professional dissenting ministers of every description
in 1851 was only 8,658.</p>
<p>A very tangible mode of settling the question which body has
done most to evangelise the people would be to inquire how much
each has spent?&nbsp; The &ldquo;Society for the Liberation of
Religion,&rdquo; in a tract they have put forth, grounded on the
Census report, states that the achievements of voluntaryism
during the half century have been
&ldquo;astonishing.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the authority of Mr. Edward
Baines, they assume that of the 16,689 dissenting chapels opened
since 1801, &ldquo;only&rdquo; 10,000 are separate buildings, and
that the cost of each has been &ldquo;but&rdquo;
&pound;1,500&mdash;in other words, that dissenters have spent
&pound;15,000,000 on their meeting-houses during the last fifty
years!&nbsp; That would, indeed, be an &ldquo;astonishing&rdquo;
result, but it is not half so surprising as the perfervid
imagination which dictated the calculation.&nbsp; In point of
fact, it is equivalent to saying that the dissenters have
provided three millions of permanent sittings, at the rate of
five pounds per sitting.&nbsp; The real truth, however, is that
they have not supplied more than two millions and three quarters
of new sittings of any kind; and when it is considered in how
many cases opening a new meeting-house means hiring a room or
building, in the popular phrase, &ldquo;on tick&rdquo;; when it
is further borne in mind that the average cost of churches is not
above &pound;5 or &pound;6 per sitting, it will be admitted that
five or six millions sterling would be a remarkably liberal sum
to put down for the amount really raised by dissenters for the
purpose of self-extension <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>during the half century.&nbsp; On the
other hand, the sum which must have been spent on churches cannot
have been less than ten or twelve millions&mdash;of which
one-half has been raised during the ten years
1841&ndash;51.&nbsp; The expenditure on church extension at the
present moment is at least five times as great as that of all the
dissenters put together.</p>
<p>The votaries of <i>Iscariotism</i>, or the &ldquo;cheap and
nasty&rdquo; in religion, will perhaps turn this fact to account,
and abuse Churchmen for lavishing such large sums of money on a
few buildings, while there is so much spiritual destitution
calling for relief.&nbsp; They will perhaps say, &ldquo;Look what
an amount of spiritual agency the Dissenters bring to bear for
half the sum you expend; and, after all, the Dissenters
&lsquo;get more out of&rsquo; their buildings than
Churchmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; At first sight, Mr. Mann&rsquo;s tables
appear to justify this assertion; but here, as in every other
respect, they only mislead.&nbsp; According to Table 16 there
were on the Census Sunday 190 services in every 100 dissenting
places of worship; whereas, there were only 171 in the same
number of churches.&nbsp; But if this table be any criterion, it
would appear that the machinery of Dissent is, by comparison,
more efficient in the rural districts than in the towns; for
while the Non-conformists opened their town buildings on the
average 2.10 times, and the Churchmen 2.06 times, they opened
their country buildings 1.84 times and the Churchmen only 1.64
times.&nbsp; Yet it must be obvious that the proportion of
country congregations which possess a regular ministry must be
very small, the greater part of the 8,658 professional Dissenting
preachers being required for the towns.&nbsp; The fact is, the
majority of country meeting-houses are served by non-professional
persons.&nbsp; As soon as the morning service is over in the
towns, a swarm of &ldquo;Spiritual Bashi-Bazooks,&rdquo; issue
forth, who, for the rest of the day, play the more ambitious, if
not more edifying, <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of preacher.&nbsp; The sort
of congregations to which they minister may be gathered from a
comparison of the number of meeting-houses and the number of
sittings open at the different periods of the day:&mdash;</p>

<p>So that in the afternoon, with only 537 fewer places open, the
number of sittings was 1,139,759 fewer than in the morning.&nbsp;
In the evening (when, of course, all the more important buildings
which were open in the morning were again accessible to the
public) the exertions of 3,744 additional preachers, nearly a
third more, only rendered available 337,850 additional sittings,
or about one-eleventh more; and they attracted only 97,668
additional hearers, an increase of less than one in
twenty-one!&nbsp; It may, perhaps, be allowable to doubt whether
the labours of non-resident, non-professional preachers can be
attended with any <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>results worth speaking of; but, at all events, their
irregular ministrations can have no real bearing on the question
whether the regular meeting-houses are used more or less
frequently than the churches.&nbsp; Obviously, the fairest way
would be to inquire which class of buildings are opened the
oftener throughout the whole week; and, in that case, there is no
doubt that the comparison would show greatly in favour of the
churches.&nbsp; If, however, we must confine ourselves to Sunday,
the proper question to ask would be&mdash;in how many cases there
is a service before, and another after, noon?&nbsp; The answer,
according to Table 16, would be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>If the investigation could be limited to the new
accommodation, the result would strikingly show that the extra
outlay on the churches had in no sense been thrown away.</p>
<p>After all, the number of sittings a religious body can open in
the morning is the real test of its strength.&nbsp; Amongst
persons of every denomination there is a strong feeling that they
ought to frequent their own place of worship in the morning, but
in the after part of the day many persons do not consider
themselves called upon to attend again, or they feel themselves
at liberty to visit other churches or meetings.&nbsp; In short,
to speak technically, the morning service is looked upon by
everybody as a service of &ldquo;obligation,&rdquo; while all the
rest are regarded as mere services of
&ldquo;devotion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, of the 5,317,915 sittings
belonging to the Church, no fewer than 4,852,645 were actually
available on the Census morning.&nbsp; The remaining 465,270 were
almost exclusively in the country, where one clergyman has still
often to serve more than one parish or chapelry.&nbsp; Cases of
this kind have of late years been much diminished, owing to the
operation of the Pluralities Act, and still more in consequence
of the increased zeal, both of the clergy and the laity.&nbsp;
The Bishop of Salisbury stated in his primary charge that the
number of churches in that diocese having two sermons on Sunday
had increased during the episcopate of Dr. Denison (16 years)
from 143 to 426; and the number having monthly communions from 35
to 181.&nbsp; The increase in the number of church sittings
during the past half century may be considered as nett, for there
can be no doubt that nearly all the new buildings have the double
service.&nbsp; At all events, if there are any that have not,
they are more than compensated for by those ancient churches
where there was formerly only one service on the Lord&rsquo;s
Day, but where there are now two.&nbsp; On the other hand, the
Dissenters are not able to open quite three-fourths of their
sittings on the Sunday morning; and as there is no reason
whatever for supposing that their new accommodation <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>is exempt
from this deduction, we may subtract one-fourth from the gross
number assigned in the tables to each period.</p>
<p>The following table, compiled on the assumption that 58 per
cent. of the population might attend divine worship on any Sunday
morning, will show at a glance the number of sittings really
required at each decennial period, and the real provision made to
supply the deficiency:&mdash;</p>

<p>This, then, is really the rate at which each body &ldquo;is
advancing in the path of self extension;&rdquo; and the best
proof of its accuracy is, that it exactly tallies with what one
would have expected beforehand.&nbsp; Mr. Mann&rsquo;s tables, on
the contrary, are absolutely incredible.&nbsp; We must never
forget, that during the Great Rebellion, Puritanism was actually
the dominant faction; and even at the Restoration it cannot be
supposed that the Dissenters were a small or an uninfluential
class.&nbsp; In 1662 no fewer than 2,000 ministers were ejected
under the new Act of Uniformity; and as at the last census there
were only 6405 professional Protestant Ministers, it will be seen
that the ejected preachers alone formed a larger body, in
comparison with the existing population, than the Protestant
Dissenting Ministry does now.&nbsp; It cannot be doubted that
every one of those men had a greater or less following; and it
must be remembered that in the days of the Commonwealth there was
always a rabble of sects who might even then be called
Dissenters.&nbsp; It is true that, after the Restoration,
Nonconformity was subjected to severe repressive laws, but those
laws were not enforced with unvarying rigour.&nbsp; In 1672 there
was the Indulgence, and in 1681 the House of Commons passed a
strong resolution against the prosecution of Protestant
Dissenters.&nbsp; Besides, after all, the Conventicle Acts only
continued in force about 23 years&mdash;not much longer, in fact,
than Episcopacy had <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>been proscribed by law.&nbsp; The natural result which
would follow the famous proclamation of James II., and the
subsequent passing of the Toleration Act, would be a great and
sudden revival of Dissent.&nbsp; How small was the church-feeling
of Parliament at the Revolution may be gathered from a curious
fact mentioned in Mr. Macaulay&rsquo;s third volume.&nbsp; It was
proposed that the Commons should sit on Easter Monday.&nbsp; The
Churchmen vigorously protested against the innovation; but they
did not dare to divide, and the House did sit on the festival in
question.&nbsp; Without at all straining the inference to be
drawn from this incident, it would be difficult, indeed, to
suppose that Churchmen had matters their own way.&nbsp; Even
under the penal laws, the Dissenters must have been a large body;
for James the Second&rsquo;s scheme for forming a coalition of
Roman Catholic and Protestant Dissenters against the
Establishment would have been stark folly unless the two bodies,
when combined, would have made up, at least, a powerful
minority.&nbsp; From the Revolution to 1801 the Dissenters had
more than a century to increase and multiply; and all the
circumstances of the case were in their favour.&nbsp; Worn out by
the political struggles of a century and a half, during which she
had been made the tool of contending factions; deprived of her
Legislative powers; silenced and frowned upon by the powers that
were, the Church had sunk into that fatal lethargy from which the
present generation has only just seen her awake.&nbsp; During
that long and dreary period, all the prominent theologians, with
a few bright exceptions, were either Dissenters or inclined to
Dissent.&nbsp; The eighteenth century, too, was the golden age of
popular Nonconformist preachers.&nbsp; Not to mention a host of
smaller names, Wesley and Whitfield both rose, flourished, and
died before its close.&nbsp; And yet, if we are to believe Mr.
Mann, the Dissenters in 1801 were a much smaller body, compared
with the whole population, than they were under the penal laws!
<a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a>&nbsp; On the other hand, all who
remember the obloquy and contempt under which the Church
continued until the passing of the Reform Act, will reject,
without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, the notion that, in 1831,
she actually possessed more accommodation, in proportion to the
population, than at the present day.&nbsp; The change which has
taken place in the popular sentiment towards her has not been
caused by any document like this Census report, which suddenly
appeared and disabused the public mind of its preconceived
ideas.&nbsp; It has, on the contrary, been brought about by the
silent influence of those spectacles of zeal and self-denying
liberality which have been witnessed <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>in every corner of the land.&nbsp;
The Church has, in fact, lived down her traducers.&nbsp; A
hundred proverbs bear witness to the vast amount of good deeds
which are required to remove an evil reputation; and yet Mr. Mann
calls upon us to believe that the Establishment has achieved
this, although, with all her numbers and all her wealth, she has
not, since 1831, done so much as the Wesleyan sects alone,
towards supplying the people with the means of religious
instruction and worship!&nbsp; One has no language to
characterize such a daring attempt on the public credulity.&nbsp;
The most charitable hypothesis will be to conclude that Mr. Mann,
though an arithmetician by his office, knows nothing about
arithmetic; and so remit him to the consideration of Mr. Roebuck
and the Administrative Reform Society. <a
name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> inquiry through which the
reader has been invited to travel will probably suggest several
considerations; and first of all the importance of putting a stop
to the statistical nuisance which has of late years flourished
with so rank a growth.&nbsp; Surely it is time that members of
both Houses of Parliament, who resent so jealously any attempt on
the part of Government officials to exceed or fall short of the
precise instructions given them, in making returns, should raise
their voices against the system of publishing with official
statistics the crude, and, as it has been seen, the nonsensical
but pernicious theorizings of the persons entrusted with the task
of compiling reports.&nbsp; Like Mr. Mantalini, the majority of
persons never trouble themselves to examine a numerical process,
but content themselves with simply asking what is the total; and
it therefore becomes the duty of Parliament to see that the
unsuspecting confidence of the public is not abused.&nbsp; The
reader must not suppose that the Report on Religious Worship is
the only recent one which is open to objection.&nbsp; The Census
Report on Schools is just as full of fallacies; and it has
certainly been one of the strangest phenomena ever witnessed in
the history of public discussion, that the schemes of Lord John
Russell and Sir John Pakington, assailed as they were on <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>every side,
should have escaped what would, after all, have been the most
effective blow that could have been aimed against them&mdash;the
simple but conclusive fact, so easily deducible from the premises
of the Report on Schools, that nearly as many children were under
education as could be induced to attend unless they were driven
to the class of the teacher by the policeman&rsquo;s staff. <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a></p>
<p>Again, the inquiry will probably satisfy the reader that the
anti-Church legislation of the day ought to proceed no
further.&nbsp; It is easy to assign the cause which in the first
instance gave it birth.&nbsp; Most statesmen, it may be presumed,
will be ready to adopt, with regard to the multifarious sects of
modern Christianity, the last clause, at least, of Gibbon&rsquo;s
famous dictum respecting the ancient religions of Pagan
Rome&mdash;&ldquo;to the people equally true, to the philosopher
equally false, to the magistrate equally useful.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Persons who profess with sincerity almost any form of Christian
doctrine are comparatively easy to govern; they throw but a light
burden upon the poor-rate and they cost nothing at all in the
shape of police.&nbsp; A statesman, then, might dislike Dissent,
but what was he to say to a state of things like that revealed in
the Census report?&nbsp; The Church, according to Mr.
Mann&rsquo;s tables, could not, by dint of the utmost exertions
she is ever likely to put forth, find accommodation for half the
souls who are year by year added to the population.&nbsp; On the
other hand the Dissenters, who are far less wealthy, and have few
endowments, provide without difficulty and without fuss more than
twice the amount of new accommodation supplied by the
Church.&nbsp; The irresistible inference in the mind of a mere
statesman would be that Dissent ought to be aided and
encouraged.&nbsp; But if <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>it turns out that the facts are
precisely the reverse of what has been represented&mdash;if in
reality Dissent is making no progress, while the Church is
providing new accommodation sufficient for the whole of the new
population&mdash;why should the Legislature go out of its path to
foster mere religious discord, and to impede the spread of what
the country has, after all, long since recognised as the
&ldquo;more excellent way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, for instance, should
Churchrates be abolished?&nbsp; If they were right in 1831, when
there were more Dissenters and fewer Churchmen, why are they
wrong now?&nbsp; If Parliament has conferred upon parishes, <i>as
a boon</i>, the right to tax themselves (if a majority of the
ratepayers think fit) for the purpose of building and maintaining
public baths, museums, and libraries, why should parishes now be
deprived of a right which they possessed before there was a
Chancellor of the Exchequer or a budget&mdash;before the Norman
set foot upon our shores, or there was a House of Commons worthy
of the name&mdash;the right to tax themselves in order to
maintain edifices which may be museums second in interest to
none, and which may have been centres of enlightenment long
before the days of Caxton and Guttenberg?</p>
<p>There is another view of the case which ought not to be
overlooked by statesmen who regard a religious Establishment as a
mere matter of police.&nbsp; Granting that Dissent teaches men to
be neither drunkards nor thieves, is it calculated to make them
as good citizens and as good neighbours as the Church?&nbsp; The
answer must surely be a negative.&nbsp; The common consent of
mankind has pronounced the famous descriptions of the old
Puritans in &ldquo;Hudibras&rdquo; to be almost as applicable to
modern Dissenters as to their ancient prototypes.&nbsp; Nor,
indeed, would it be easy, if they were not, to account for the
popularity of Butler&rsquo;s oft-quoted lines; for even just
satires, to say nothing of unjustifiable lampoons, rarely survive
the persons against whom they are directed.&nbsp; Of course, men
are often much better than the system to which they belong.&nbsp;
There are hundreds&mdash;nay, thousands&mdash;of Dissenters whose
Dissent is a mere accident of birth and education, and who are
truly catholic at heart; but of Dissent in the abstract, no one
who has either studied its history or is acquainted with its
practical working will deny the applicability to it not only of
Butler&rsquo;s portraiture, but of another yet more famous
description, qualified in the latter case, however, with the
insertion or omission throughout of the important
word&mdash;&ldquo;not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dissent suffers not long, and
is not kind&mdash;Dissent is envious&mdash;behaves itself
unseemly&mdash;vaunts itself, and is puffed up&mdash;seeks every
tittle of its &ldquo;rights&rdquo;&mdash;is easily
provoked&mdash;thinks evil&mdash;gloats over every slip on the
part of its opponents&mdash;attributes what is good in them to a
wrong motive&mdash;will bear nothing of which it can rid itself
by agitation or clamour&mdash;will put a good construction upon
nothing when an evil one <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>is possible&mdash;hopes
nothing&mdash;endures nothing.&nbsp; If this were not so, how
would it be possible to account for its inveterate propensity to
internal schism?&nbsp; The scriptural account of the Kingdom of
Heaven is that it should grow as from a seed; but Dissent is
propagated chiefly by <i>cuttings</i>.&nbsp; It is not yet two
hundred years since the Kirk was established in Scotland, and yet
there are no fewer than six sorts of Presbyterians.&nbsp; The
case of Wesleyanism is still worse.&nbsp; Within sixty years
after the death of its founder it had split into seven
antagonistic sects.&nbsp; Whitfield himself quarrelled with
Wesley, and his followers have, since his death, separated into
two bodies.&nbsp; There are four sorts of Baptists.&nbsp; Of the
Independents, Mr. Mann speaks with refreshing innocence as
forming &ldquo;a compact and undivided body.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
would be nearer the truth to say that they consist of nearly as
many sects as there are meeting-houses.&nbsp; Nearly every
congregation is of volcanic origin, and every one contains within
it elements which might at any moment explode and shatter the
whole concern.</p>
<p>That the writer may not be thought to be unsupported by facts,
he will here summarize the history of Anabaptistic and
Congregational Dissent in the first town to the annals of which
he has ready access&mdash;Nottingham, his authority being Mr.
Wylie&rsquo;s local history, published in 1853.&nbsp; Nottingham,
however, is a remarkably good example for the purpose.&nbsp; It
has a manufacturing population of 57,000, having doubled itself
since 1801.&nbsp; It is almost at the head of those places in
which Dissent is most rampant, and the Church most
depressed.&nbsp; It possessed, according to Mr. Mann&rsquo;s
table K, 35.2 Dissenting sittings to every hundred inhabitants,
the only other places equal or superior to it in that respect
being Merthyr Tydvil (52.4), Sunderland (35.2), Rochdale (36.5),
and Swansea (42.8).&nbsp; It boasts of 74.1 per cent. of the
whole religious accommodation within its boundaries, the only
places having more being Merthyr (89.7), and Rochdale (78.7).</p>
<blockquote><p>About the middle of the last century, then, the
Presbyterian congregation on the High Pavement adopted Socinian
tenets; and many families thereupon left it and joined a small
congregation of Calvinistic Independents in Castle-gate.&nbsp;
Their meeting-house was immediately enlarged, and it has ever
since been considered the leading Dissenting place of
worship.&nbsp; In 1761, a second secession from High Pavement,
this time of Sabellians, built themselves a new meeting-house in
Halifax-place.&nbsp; In 1801, they erected themselves a new
building in St. Mary&rsquo;s-gate, which has long since been
closed.&nbsp; In 1798, a third swarm, again Calvinistic
Independents, left High Pavement, and settled in the
Halifax-place meeting-house, vacated by their Sabellian
predecessors.&nbsp; In 1819, they built themselves a new
meeting-house, called &ldquo;Zion Chapel,&rdquo; in
Fletcher-gate, the old one being now a school.&nbsp; In 1822, a
secession from Castle-gate built a new meeting-house in St.
James&rsquo;s-street; and six years later a secession from St.
James&rsquo;s-street built a meeting-house in Friar-lane.&nbsp;
In 1804, a secession from Zion Chapel erected &ldquo;Hephzibah
Chapel,&rdquo; which being in debt, was sold to the Universalists
in 1808, and was soon afterwards converted into a National
School.&nbsp; In 1828, another secession from &ldquo;Zion
Chapel&rdquo; erected a meeting called &ldquo;Bethesda
Chapel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General Baptists at first met in a disused Wesleyan
meeting-house, called &ldquo;The Tabernacle,&rdquo; which has
long since been pulled down.&nbsp; In 1799 they built themselves
a place in Stoney-street.&nbsp; In 1817 a quarrel arose between
Mr. Smith, the senior pastor, and his junior, of whose pulpit
talents he was said to be jealous.&nbsp; The congregation
dismissed them both, and appointed a Mr. George.&nbsp; On Sunday,
the 3rd of August, in <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>the same year, there was a personal
conflict after the Donnybrook manner, between the partisans of
Smith and George.&nbsp; The friends of Smith being beaten drew
off, and built themselves a meeting-house in Broad-street.&nbsp;
In 1850 there was another secession from Stoney-street, who built
themselves a meeting-house on the Mansfield-road.</p>
<p>The Particular Baptists originally occupied an ancient
meeting-house in Park-street: but in 1815 they built themselves a
larger place in George-street.&nbsp; In 1847 there was a
secession of extra-Particulars.&nbsp; These met first in a room
in Clinton-street, then in an old building which had been disused
by the Quakers, and finally, in a splendid gothic edifice, which
they built for themselves on Derby-road.&nbsp; The old
meeting-house in Park-street fell into the hands of a
congregation of the Scotch variety of the sect, whose peace has
only been disturbed by the Bethesdians, who joined them in 1828,
until they decided upon setting up for themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus it will be seen that of the nine new congregations
enumerated above, not one was originated without a
quarrel&mdash;a quarrel, too, of the worst kind, a personal
one.&nbsp; Nobody can study the history of religious polemics
without perceiving that the root of all that bitterness which has
made the <i>odium theologicum</i> a proverb, is to be found in
the tendency there is in men to transfer the indignation they
might reasonably feel against error, from the error itself to
those who hold it.&nbsp; If people would only consent to forget
history and would conduct the argument upon purely abstract
principles, even the Roman controversy might be made instructive
and edifying; but somehow, before long, the debate wanders away
from the truth or falsehood of the creed under discussion to that
most irrelevant of all issues, the virtues or failings of those
by whom it is professed.&nbsp; What shall we say, then, of a
system which gives rise to controversies which, from their
commencement to their close, are purely personal?&nbsp; Lest it
should be supposed that the case of Nottingham is an isolated
instance, here is an extract on which the writer stumbled the
other day in a tract written in praise of Congregationalism, and
stated on the title page to be &ldquo;commended by J. Bennett,
D.D.&rdquo;&nbsp; It appears to be quoted from a work called
&ldquo;The Library of Ecclesiastical Knowledge,&rdquo; and the
scene of the incident is stated to be &ldquo;one of the principal
cities of the United States:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A Baptist congregation, originally small, had
increased so rapidly that an enlargement of the chapel became
necessary.&nbsp; It was immediately effected.&nbsp; The
congregation still continued to increase, and a second time it
became necessary to enlarge.&nbsp; Everything still going on
prosperously, a third enlargement, some time after, was
proposed.&nbsp; The noble-minded pastor, however, thinking that
he had already as much on his hands as any mere mortal could
conscientiously discharge, with a generous contempt for his own
interests, opposed this step, and suggested that they should
exert themselves to raise a new interest, entirely independent of
the old one.&nbsp; The people entered cheerfully into his design;
nay, they made a nobler sacrifice than that of their money.&nbsp;
For as soon as the new building was finished, one of the deacons,
with a few of the most respectable members of the old church,
voluntarily separated from it, and proceeded to form the infant
<i>colony</i> that had branched off from the mother church.&nbsp;
What is still more delightful, the two churches formed a common
fund for the erection of a third chapel.&nbsp; This was soon
accomplished.&nbsp; In a short time a large and flourishing
church was the result; and, at the time our informant related
this fact, all three churches were actually subscribing towards a
fourth chapel.&nbsp; This is noble conduct.&nbsp; Who can tell
how soon cities and towns might be evangelised, if this principle
were sternly (!) acted upon?&nbsp; A somewhat similar fact has,
we understand, been recently witnessed in a city of our own
country, where some congregational churches have imitated their
Baptist brethren of America.&nbsp; When will all ministers
&ldquo;go and do likewise?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>This is
truly edifying and amusing.&nbsp; First of all, mark the
<i>habitat</i> of this Nonconformist ph&oelig;nix, a congregation
which has actually given birth to another without a preliminary
quarrel.&nbsp; We must actually cross the Atlantic, and seek the
phenomenon in the land where the penny-a-liner places his
sea-serpents, and his other choicer wonders.&nbsp; To increase
without envy, hatred, and uncharitableness is, it seems, to a
Dissenter, something inexpressibly &ldquo;noble&rdquo;&mdash;and
brotherly love is something that must be &ldquo;sternly&rdquo;
acted upon!&nbsp; We may be quite certain that it is something
the congregational sects very rarely see, or it would not throw
them into such lamentable, and yet, in some sense, ludicrous
contortions of surprise.</p>
<p>Perhaps some Dissenter will be whispering, after the manner of
Mr. Roebuck, the three words, Gorham, Liddell, Denison; but the
<i>tu quoque</i> wholly fails.&nbsp; In the first place, it is
the surprising peculiarity of the present Church controversies
that the noisiest, if not the weightiest, disputants are not
Churchmen at all.&nbsp; In the next place, those who are
Churchmen, and enter with any bitterness into the strife, are
remarkable neither for their number nor their influence.&nbsp;
The great party in the Church of England is, after all, the
middle party; and however fierce the cannonade which the extreme
left, and its allies outside the pale, may direct against the
extreme right, their missiles fly harmlessly over the vast body
which lies between.&nbsp; The truth is, the recent outburst of
controversy, so far as the Church herself is responsible for it,
is nothing but the natural recoil of that conservative sentiment
which must always be a powerful feeling in a religious community,
from doctrines and usages which had become unfamiliar.&nbsp; As
the unfamiliarity passes away, the controversy will also
gradually cease.&nbsp; Already the doctrines and usages in
question have been unconsciously adopted by many of those who
fancy themselves most opposed to them; and, indeed, if our
doughtiest combatants would only take pains to understand what it
is their antagonists really hold, they would often find that they
are fighting against mere shadows.&nbsp; The recent suits in the
ecclesiastical courts cannot but open the eyes of Churchmen to
the extreme tenuity of the points in dispute.&nbsp; Take the S.
Barnabas case.&nbsp; Everybody will remember the language which
was applied to the &ldquo;practices&rdquo; revived by Mr.
Bennett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Popish,&rdquo; &ldquo;histrionic,&rdquo;
&ldquo;mummery,&rdquo; were the mildest terms in the repertory of
that gentleman&rsquo;s assailants.&nbsp; Those
&ldquo;practices&rdquo; remain to this day&mdash;if anything,
they have been elaborated rather than subjected to any mitigating
process.&nbsp; Messrs. Westerton and Beal bring the matter before
the proper tribunal; but what are the only issues they can find
to raise?&nbsp; Such notable questions as whether the cross,
which glitters on the crown, the orb, and sceptre of the
Sovereign, which glows on the national banner, which crowns
almost every church <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>gable in the land, with which every Churchman is marked
at his baptism, which the very Socinians place upon their
buildings, is, forsooth, a lawful ornament?&mdash;whether a table
ceases to be a table by being made of stone?&mdash;whether the
altar which has never been moved these two hundred years, and
which nobody wants to move, must nevertheless be
movable?&mdash;whether the altar vestments and the &ldquo;fair
linen cloths&rdquo; used during Communion time, may have fringes,
or must be plain-hemmed?&nbsp; Even if Dr. Lushington&rsquo;s
judgment should eventually be confirmed, if in this age of
schools of design, Mr. Westerton&rsquo;s crusade against art
should prove successful, the alterations that would be made at S.
Barnabas would be discernible by none out the keenest
eyes&mdash;so little can there be found in matters ritual to
fight about.&nbsp; Even in the Denison case the points of
difference are almost as infinitesimal.&nbsp; It is true that
under the revived act of Elizabeth&mdash;compared with which the
laws of Draco seem a mild and considerate code&mdash;the
Archdeacon has been sentenced to lose his preferments; but his
doctrine on the Real Presence has, in sober fact, never been so
much as challenged.&nbsp; His opponents, passing over all that
was material in his propositions, have only attacked a
<i>quasi</i> corollary which he has added to his main position,
but which is, in reality, a complete <i>non-sequitur</i>.&nbsp;
Whether Dr. Lushington is right or wrong, it is clear that a
person holding the dogma of transubstantiation itself might, with
perfect logical consistency, accept the ruling of the Court.</p>
<p>The differences between the highest and the lowest schools
being so impalpable, it would seem absurd to suppose that the
present controversies can have a much longer continuance.&nbsp;
But whether that be so or not, there is a very important
distinction (and one that is well worth the notice of statesmen)
between the extension of the Church and the spread of
Dissent.&nbsp; Church extension, as far as it goes, tends to
compose differences.&nbsp; The consecration of a new church is
almost invariably regarded as an occasion when party differences
should be laid aside&mdash;the opening of a new meeting-house is
too commonly the crowning act of an irreparable schism.</p>
<p>Another lesson which the report of Mr. Mann ought to teach
Churchmen is the necessity there is for insisting upon the next
religious census being made a complete and accurate one.&nbsp;
The next religious census ought to include all such institutions
as colleges, workhouses, hospitals, and the like&mdash;it ought
to be enforced by the same penalties as the civil census; and it
ought to be understood that all the returns would be printed in a
blue book.&nbsp; With these precautions the Church need not fear
the result.&nbsp; Even if the census of 1861 should prove no more
trustworthy than that of 1851, it will remove a great deal of the
misconceptions to which the latter has given rise.&nbsp; As far
as one may judge, the work of church extension is progressing
just as rapidly now <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>as it was ten years ago; the number of the clergy is
just as rapidly augmenting; <a name="citation33"></a><a
href="#footnote33" class="citation">[33]</a> and as all
additional clergymen have now to be supported on the voluntary
principle, we may presume that they follow the ordinary laws of
supply and demand.&nbsp; We may, therefore, confidently expect
that the number of church sittings open on the census morning in
1861 will not be fewer than six millions; and if there be an
average attendance (which there was not on the last occasion) the
number of persons present will be about three millions and a
half.&nbsp; That the Dissenters will be able to open any more
sittings than in 1851, is doubtful; for it must be remembered
that since 1841 the Church has been annually absorbing a
population equal to the entire yearly increase.&nbsp; But
allowing them the same increase as has been assigned to them for
the decade 1841&ndash;51, they will not be able to open more than
four million sittings, and they will not have more than two
millions and a half of attendants.&nbsp; This estimate is formed
on the supposition that the next census will be made on the
voluntary principle like the last.&nbsp; If a more complete and
accurate account is taken, the result may be very
different.&nbsp; It is quite within the bounds of possibility
that the number of church attendants may turn out to be near four
millions, while that of the Dissenters may not much exceed
two.</p>
<p>Looking at all the facts of the case, there is every reason
why the Church should take courage.&nbsp; Never since the
Reformation has she had so much real power for good&mdash;never
has she been so free from abuses.&nbsp; Each year sees thousands
returning to the fold from which they or their parents had
strayed; each year sees her enemies more and more &ldquo;dwindle,
peak, and pine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everything, too, points to a daily
acceleration of the process.&nbsp; At the very time that
Convocation is resuming its functions, the Non-conformist Union
is compelled by internal dissentions to abandon their yearly
meeting.&nbsp; What Mr. Miall calls &ldquo;the dissidence of
dissent&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, all in it that is
pre-eminently narrow-minded, ignorant, and infected with
bigotry&mdash;is concentrating itself, and is thus getting free
the more respectable elements of modern non-conformity.&nbsp;
Meanwhile the better class of Dissenters are doing all in their
power to cut the ground from under their own feet.&nbsp; They are
building &ldquo;steeple-houses,&rdquo; inventing liturgies, and
adopting even choral services; in other words they are expressing
in the most emphatic manner their opinion that the whole theory
of dissent is wrong.&nbsp; For a short time a Brummagem
ecclesiology may satisfy them; but in the end they will no doubt
rank themselves amongst the best sons of the Church.&nbsp; The
truth is, there is no other religious community at the present
day which can bid <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>so high for the reverent attachment of Englishmen.&nbsp;
Whatever the claims of Rome&mdash;her antiquity, her catholicity,
her apostolicity&mdash;they are equally the Church of
England&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Her succession of bishops is the same, her
regard for the primitive church greater, her conception of
Christendom far more grand.&nbsp; The glories of the ancient
rituals belong equally to the Book of Common Prayer.&nbsp; It
contains nothing material which was not in them, there was
nothing material in them (save only certain invocations and
legends of the saints) which is not in it.&nbsp; The Prayer Book
is, in fact, nothing but a translation (magnificently done) of
the older offices, a little compressed and simplified.&nbsp; The
structure is the same&mdash;the mode of using it the same; and if
it has lost somewhat of the multiplied ceremonies which were
anciently observed, it has gained far more in the majesty and
breadth which it has acquired from its thoroughly congregational
character.&nbsp; Besides, it is throughout a reality, whereas the
office books of the Latin Communion have, to some extent at
least, become a sham.&nbsp; Thus the Breviary has long since been
practically abolished as a public form of prayer, and even as a
manual of private devotions for the clergy, that which forms its
staple, the Book of Psalms, has been virtually reduced to a
fourth its bulk.&nbsp; In nearly a thousand churches belonging to
the Anglican communion the whole Psalter is publicly recited
every month, and in twenty times that number it is said through
twice every year.</p>
<p>If Protestant Dissenters boast of their enlightenment or of
their reverence for Scripture, the Church may meet them on that
ground likewise with the utmost confidence.&nbsp; The Prayer-book
scarcely recognises a person to be a Churchman if he cannot read;
and she directs some forty psalms and some thirty chapters of the
Bible to be gone through every week.&nbsp; In a word, approach
the Church of England from the most opposite points, and she will
be found to possess exactly that attribute which a person might
think is most admirable.&nbsp; The man who reverences
antiquity&mdash;who has a taste for art&mdash;who has a passion
for ritual&mdash;who would have everything &ldquo;understanded of
the people,&rdquo;&mdash;he who insists upon ranks and
orders&mdash;and he who stands up for popular rights, will
equally find in the Church of this country the very quality which
he deems important.&nbsp; Never was there any institution so
&ldquo;many-sided;&rdquo; never one that became with so much
success &ldquo;all things to all men.&rdquo;&nbsp; How she could
ever have lost her hold on the affections of Englishmen is indeed
wonderful; but, in truth, until lately, she has never had a
chance of making herself understood.&nbsp; <i>Now</i>, for the
first time, her theory is beginning to be appreciated; and the
success which has attended her, wonderful as it has been, is
probably but the foretaste of a future more brilliant than
anything of which we can now form an idea.</p>

fifty thousand families, or three quarters of a million persons;
in other words, at about a sixth of the population.&nbsp; If the
Dissenters had in 1801 only 881,240 sittings, their number of
morning attendants would be considerably less than 400,000; and,
allowing each attendant to represent three persons, that would

be pointed out that the result so arrived at could not be true
unless the number of persons in each class was exactly the
same.&nbsp; A man who had invested in the Great Western Railway
&pound;900 which yielded him two per cent., and &pound;100 in the
South Western which paid him six, might say, on Mr.
Mayhew&rsquo;s principle, that he had invested &pound;1000 at 4

&pound;40&mdash;&pound;2.8 percent. instead of &pound;4.</p>
<p><a name="footnote27"></a><a href="#citation27"
class="footnote">[27]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Mann calculates that without
in the least interfering with juvenile labour, and without
questioning the discretion of parents who kept children between
the ages of 3 and 5 and 12 and 15 at home, there ought to have
been more than three million children at school in 1851.&nbsp; It
would be easy to show that this estimate is based upon nothing
better than a series of blunders and bad guesses, but there is a
much shorter mode of dealing with it.&nbsp; The children of the
middle and upper classes do not remain under professional
instructors at home or at school for a longer average period than
six years.&nbsp; Now, the total number of children in 1851
between the ages of 4 and 10 was 2,484,866, or 13.8 per cent. of
the entire population.&nbsp; The number actually on the school
books was 2,200,000, or 12.2 per cent.&nbsp; So that either all
the children in the country were at school, but the average time
was one-eighth too short; or the average time was of the right
length, but the number of scholars was one-eighth too few.&nbsp;
The truth, of course, lay somewhere between these two
alternatives.&nbsp; Since 1851 considerable progress has no doubt
been made; but it unfortunately turns out that the effect of
improved machinery is not to improve the general education, but
merely to shorten the time allotted to schooling.&nbsp; It is
found that if by better modes of tuition a child can be made
sooner to acquire what its parents think sufficient for it to
know, it is only so much the sooner taken away.&nbsp; It would
therefore be vain to expect that the school per centage will ever
be much higher than it was in 1851&mdash;at least, until the
middle classes raise their own standard.&nbsp; Of the children on
the schoolbooks in 1851, the per centage of actual daily
attendants was 83&mdash;91 for the private, and 79 for the public
scholar.&nbsp; In America, where the schools are wholly free, the
per centage was still less.&nbsp; In Massachusetts, for example,
it was only 75.&nbsp; In other words, the attendance in England
and Wales in 1851 was 1,826,000 daily.&nbsp; If the 2,200,000 had
all been private scholars, it would have been 2,002,000.&nbsp; On
the other hand if there had been 2,400,000 free scholars, it
would only have been 1,800,000.&nbsp; These figures will speak
for themselves.</p>
<p><a name="footnote33"></a><a href="#citation33"
class="footnote">[33]</a>&nbsp; The number of additional clergy
ordained every year is stated to be 300.&nbsp; The number

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
